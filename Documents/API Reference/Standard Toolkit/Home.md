# Welcome to the Krypton standard toolkit suite library documentation.

The Krypton Suite contains user interface components designed to make it quick and easy for developers to create professional looking applications. It provides the essential building blocks needed to create a consistent look and feel across all your products. You can use the built-in palettes to achieve the same appearance as industry standard applications such as Microsoft Office 2007/2010/2013/365. Alternatively you can create your own custom palettes to create a completely unique user interface. The Krypton Suite consists of five products called Krypton Toolkit, Krypton Ribbon, Krypton Navigator, Krypton Workspace and Krypton Docking.


## Krypton Toolkit

The Krypton Toolkit provides a set of basic user interface components for free. You can distribute the Krypton Toolkit assembly without charge or royalty with your own products. The Krypton Toolkit is great resource for speeding up development of professional looking applications. It works in tandem with the MenuStrip, StatusStrip and ToolStrip controls that come with .NET Framework controls. Using the Krypton Toolkit you can create a great looking application in just minutes.

The Krypton Ribbon is designed to mimic the look, feel and operation of the ribbon control seen in the Microsoft Office 2007/2010/2013/365 applications, such as Word and Excel. It provides advanced capabilities including the quick access toolbar, contextual tabs and auto shrinking groups. With rich design time support and sample code you can be up and running with the ribbon in no time at all. It integrates with the Krypton Toolkit architecture to ensure a consistent look and feel.

The Krypton Workspace allows a document area to be created that the user can customize by dragging and dropping pages into new positions.
